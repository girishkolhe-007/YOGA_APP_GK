                <p>Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. It is an art and scince of healthy living.

As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature. According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi, having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or moksha. Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or ‘freedom’ (Kaivalya). Living with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice."Yoga” also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realize this union and achieve mastery over their destiny.Yoga, being widely considered as an ‘immortal cultural outcome’ of Indus Saraswati Valley civilization – dating back to 2700 B.C., has proved itself catering to both material and spiritual upliftment of humanity.Basic humane values are the very identity of Yoga Sadhana. </p>

            <div class="info1">
                <h5><b>What is the yoga diet?</b></h5>
                <p>The yogic diet stresses the consumption of natural, unprocessed foods that promote spiritual, mental, and physical health and aligns with yogic philosophy. It’s based primarily on the yogic principles of ahimsa, sattva, and saucha.</p>
                <img src="img/yogaDiet.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;height:360px;margin: 5px;"/>
                <p><b>Ahimsa</b> is commonly translated to non-violence. Ahimsa is the idea that all living things are connected and that the world would be a better place if you do not harm living things. The most obvious way to not cause harm is to reduce or eliminate the consumption of meat and dairy products.</p>
                <p><b>Sattva</b> is a state of equanimity that yogic practices aim to cultivate. A diet that is abundant in sattvic foods will promote a calm heart and a clear mind. Sattvic foods are generally fresh vegetables, whole grains and beans, mild healing spices, and other mildly sweet fruits and vegetables.</p>
                <p><b>Saucha</b> is the practice of purity and cleanliness. One of the simplest ways to promote saucha is to remove or reduce impurities in your body by only eating organic foods, which are free of chemicals.</p>
                
                <h5><b>Healthy Food</b></h5>
                <p><li>Enjoy a variety of foods from each food group to help reduce the risk of developing diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Choose foods with little to no added sugar, saturated fats, and sodium.</li></p>
                <p><li>To get enough protein throughout the day and maintain muscle, try adding seafood, dairy, or fortified soy products along with beans, peas, and lentils to your meals. Learn more about protein and other important nutrients.
                Add sliced or chopped fruits and vegetables to meals and snacks. Look for pre-cut varieties if slicing and chopping are a challenge for you.</li></p>
                <p><li>Try foods fortified with vitamin B12, such as some cereals, or talk to your doctor about taking a B12 supplement. Learn more about key vitamins and minerals.</li></p>
                <li>Reduce sodium intake by seasoning foods with herbs and citrus such as lemon juice.
                Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help stay hydrated and aid in the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients. Avoid sugary drinks.</li></p>
            </div>

            <div class="info1">
                <h5><b>Heart Disease Prevention</b></h5>
                <p>Combining a healthy diet with regular exercise is the best way of maintaining a healthy weight. Having a healthy weight reduces your chances of developing high blood pressure. Regular exercise will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.</p>
                <p>Exercising regularly reduces your risk of having a heart attack. The heart is a muscle and, like any other muscle, benefits from exercise. A strong heart can pump more blood around your body with less effort. Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy.</p>
                
                <h5><b>Obesity Prevention</b></h5>
                <p><b>Yoga for Obesity in Elders</b>
                Yoga practice heals and cures multiple ills. Therefore, yoga is recommended for weight loss too. According to research published on the NCBI’s website (National Center for Biotechnology Information), yoga practice can also psychologically help in obesity. Yoga improves a person’s muscles and metabolic functioning, which can lead to weight loss. 
                <p><li><b>Tadasana</b></li>
                It is advisable to do Tadasana before the other asanas. It helps to reduce fat and eases obesity. With regular tadasana practice, the whole body feels stretched and energetic, leading to an improved blood flow. Simultaneously, it makes the digestive system healthy, corrects the blood circulation, and strengthens bones. This is a simple asana, which is hugely beneficial not just for obesity but also for the elders’ overall well-being.</p>
                <p><li><b>Trikonasana</b></li>
                While doing basic Yoga, the body is in a triangle-like posture, which is why it is called trikonasana. It is considered to be the most useful and straightforward posture, especially for adults suffering from obesity.</p>
                <p><li><b>Padahastasana</b></li>
                Padahastasana is composed of three Sanskrit words- pada means foot, hasta means hands, and asana means posture. While performing this yoga, the hands are kept close to the feet on the ground, due to which it is called Padahastasana. It accelerates blood flow throughout the body. While helping to reduce obesity, this Yoga also eases stiffness in the elderly body.</p>
                
                <h5><b>Bone strengthen</b></h5>
                <p><li><b>Exercise</b></li>
                    Just 30 minutes of exercise each day can help strengthen bones and prevent osteoporosis.Weight-bearing exercises, such as yoga, tai chi, and even walking, help the body resist gravity and stimulate bone cells to grow. Strength-training builds muscles which also increases bone strength.</p>
                <p><li><b>Make sure your body absorbs the calcium and vitamin D it needs</b></li>
                    Sunlight helps the body absorb vitamin D from the foods you eat. Experts recommend five to 10 minutes of sun exposure (without sunscreen) on the hands, arms, and face, two to three times a week, to help the body process the necessary vitamin D for bone health.</p>
